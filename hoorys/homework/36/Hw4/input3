s = """Python is an interpreted high-level and general-purpose programming language
Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace
Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear logical code for small and large-scale projects

Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected
It supports multiple programming paradigms including structured object-oriented and functional programming
Python is often described as a batteries included language due to its comprehensive standard library

Python was created in the late 1980s and first released in 1991 by Guido van Rossum as a successor to the ABC programming language
Python 2.0 released in 2000 introduced new features such as list comprehensions and a garbage collection system with reference counting and was discontinued with version 2.7 in 2020
Python 3.0 released in 2008 was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible and much Python 2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3
With Python 2's end-of-life only Python 3.6.x and later are supported with older versions still supporting e.g
Windows 7

Python interpreters are supported for mainstream operating systems and available for a few more
A global community of programmers develops and maintains CPython a free and open-source reference implementation
A non-profit organization the Python Software Foundation manages and directs resources for Python and CPython development

As of December 2020 Python ranked third in TIOBEs index of most popular programming languages behind C and Java
